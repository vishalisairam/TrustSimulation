# TrustSimulation

Comments for submission (Please look at the 'Final' Folder)

A. We had planned three components in our project:
- Interactive Game with human input
- Simulation with input on proportion of playertypes and number of turns
- GUI for presentation

B. We completed the game and simulation as programs and we also have a basic structure for the GUI (Pygame GUI for the Game and tkinter GUI for Simulation)

C. However, we struggled with merging the final game and simulation codes with the respective GUI codes. The Human Input for both the Game and Simulation work in the console but not with the GUI. 
- In the Game, '0' is Cooperate and '1' is defect.
